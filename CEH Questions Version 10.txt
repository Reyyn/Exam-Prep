(Exam Topic 4) You have successfully gained access to a linux server and would like to ensure that the succeeding outgoing traffic from this server will not be caught by a Network Based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). What is the best way to evade the NIDS? 

A.
 Encryption 

C.
 Alternate Data Streams 

D.
 Out of band signalling 



Answer: A 
Explanation: 
When the NIDS encounters encrypted traffic, the only analysis it can perform is packet level analysis, since the application layer contents are inaccessible. Given that exploits against today's networks are primarily targeted against network services (application layer entities), packet level analysis ends up doing very little to protect our core business assets.

(Exam Topic 4) How does the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) work? 

A.
 It sends a request packet to all the network elements, asking for the MAC address from a specific IP. 

B.
 It sends a reply packet to all the network elements, asking for the MAC address from a specific IP. 

C.
 It sends a reply packet for a specific IP, asking for the MAC address. 

D.
 It sends a request packet to all the network elements, asking for the domain name from a specific IP. 


Answer: A 
Explanation: 
When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular local area network arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a physical host or MAC address that matches the IP address. The ARP program looks in the ARP cache and, if it finds the address, provides it so that the packet can be converted to the right packet length and format and sent to the machine. If no entry is found for the IP address, ARP broadcasts a request packet in a special format to all the machines on the LAN to see if one machine knows that it has that IP address associated with it. A machine that recognizes the IP address as its own returns a reply so indicating. ARP updates the ARP cache for future reference and then sends the packet to the MAC address that replied.

(Exam Topic 4) env x=`(){ :;};echo exploit` bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd' What is the Shellshock bash vulnerability attempting to do on a vulnerable Linux host? 

A.
 Display passwd content to prompt 

B.
 Removes the passwd file 

C.
 Changes all passwords in passwd 

D.
 Add new user to the passwd file 


Answer: A 

Explanation: 
To extract private information, attackers are using a couple of techniques. The simplest extraction attacks are in the form: () {:;}; /bin/cat /etc/passwd That reads the password file /etc/passwd, and adds it to the response from the web server. So an attacker injecting this code through the Shellshock vulnerability would see the password file dumped out onto their screen as part of the web page returned.

(Exam Topic 4) You have successfully compromised a machine on the network and found a server that is alive on the same network. You tried to ping it but you didn't get any response back. What is happening? 

A.
 ICMP could be disabled on the target server. 

B.
 The ARP is disabled on the target server. 

C.
 TCP/IP doesn't support ICMP. 

D.
 You need to run the ping command with root privileges. 


Answer: A 
Explanation: 
The ping utility is implemented using the ICMP "Echo request" and "Echo reply" messages. Note: The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the main protocols of the internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

(Exam Topic 4) Which of the following is the BEST way to defend against network sniffing? 

A.
 Using encryption protocols to secure network communications 

B.
 Register all machines MAC Address in a Centralized Database 

C.
 Restrict Physical Access to Server Rooms hosting Critical Servers 

D.
 Use Static IP Address 


Answer: A 
Explanation: 
A way to protect your network traffic from being sniffed is to use encryption such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). Encryption doesn't prevent packet sniffers from seeing source and destination information, but it does encrypt the data packet's payload so that all the sniffer sees is encrypted gibberish.

A.
 Transport layer port numbers and application layer headers 

B.
 Presentation layer headers and the session layer port numbers 

C.
 Network layer headers and the session layer port numbers 

D.
 Application layer port numbers and the transport layer headers 


Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Newer firewalls can filter traffic based on many packet attributes like source IP address, source port, destination IP address or transport layer port, destination service like WWW or FTP. They can filter based on protocols, TTL values, netblock of originator, of the source, and many other attributes. Application layer firewalls are responsible for filtering at 3, 4, 5, 7 layer. Because they analyze the application layer headers, most firewall control and filtering is performed actually in the software.
